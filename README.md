# Webster PINN for Singing Voice Synthesis

Code coming soon  
(Repository created for ICASSP 2026 submission.  
Full training and inference scripts will be released after acceptance.)

## 🔊 Audio Examples (AB / ABX)

👉 [Interactive demo on GitHub Pages](https://minhuilu.github.io/webster-pinn-svs/docs/audio.html)

We provide AB/ABX listening comparisons for **Reference, Post-render, DDSP-only, and In-graph**.  
Listening aligns with Tables 2–3 in the paper:  
_Post-render ≈ Reference > DDSP-only > In-graph_.
